    Text: "<i> Cold Stratification is important in the lifecycle of the Ranunculus
      dissectifolius\r </i>\nThe seeds of this plant won\u2019t germinate until they
      have experienced a period of cold and wet conditions in the soil underneath
      the snow before it germinates in the spring. \r\n\r\n<i> Why cold stratification?
      \r</i>\nIf seeds sprout before winter they will go through a cold winter as
      a tiny seedling, which is a harsh environment for a seedling in an alpine area.
